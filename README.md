# CIKM2023_SubspaceEmbedding
Pluggable Embedding Code of our CIKM paper titled "Lightweight Adaptation of Neural Language Models via Subspace Embedding"

#### Subspace Embedding
- Embedding layer can be customised.
- Follow the parameters detail in the paper to reproduce the subspace of the embedding.
- Practically, the training/inference speed is similar with Embedding layer.
